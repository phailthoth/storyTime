 
I decided to go to the railroads nearby.
Ayaya
It's awfully dark out here, do they not need lights in this area?
 
I struggled around in the dark. Luckily, I had the rails to guide me where I was off to.
 
I suppose I was fortunate enough not to meet any trains along the way.
Ayaya
Oh look, a bench!
 
I looked around and questioned when I got to a park. Was this a well known park?
 
Somehow, I managed to get to the city by following this railroad.
 
I decided to rest on the bench for the time being, unknown of where I was.
