 
I take my leave towards the city and eventually reach the nearest city. Despite it being fairly large, I did not know about it until now.
Ayaya
Mother did not say anything about meeting anywhere around here. I wonder what she meant.
 
I slowly make my way to the city and walk around the area. Indubitably, this place was so large that I was lost.
 
After a while I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do in the city. There were too many unfathomable things going out about it.

Before I knew it, it was already dark. Should I know where I'm supposed to go?
 
For the time being, I sat near a bridge and wondered as to what I was supposed to do.
