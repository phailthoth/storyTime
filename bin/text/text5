 
Suddenly, after having the desire to go to space, I was instantly transported there.
Ayaya
Woah, woah, woah. Where am I?
 
Looking around, I couldn't help but feel lost.
 
The most interesting part was that I had no change of clothes or any form of life support. I was just floating there, unharmed.
Ayaya
Well, this is definitely weird.
???
Welcome, Ayaya! Your mom told me that you may be coming, so I took the opportunity to teleport you here.
Ayaya
Who's there?
 
I frantically looked around, finding nobody.
???
Well, I suppose I should give you my name, it's Aisu.
Aisu
I'm going to hide myself from you for the time being, it's nothing personal. The same happened when I met your mother.
Ayaya
Wait, you met my mother?
Aisu
Yeah, she was quite an interesting girl back in the day. She was best magic girl.
Ayaya
Wait, wait, wait, magic girl?
Aisu
Yeah, you're going to become a magic girl now and fly around with a silly magic wand and an unnecessarily embarrassing dress saving lives. How does that sound?
Ayaya
Can we forgo the dress?
Aisu
Nope.
 
Before I knew it, I was instantly changed and wore a frilly dress and held a wand.
Ayaya
...
Aisu
Anyways, you'll be off on your adventure now. I'll be watching you closely.
 
Before I knew it, I was sent to my first planet, more of instantly teleported there.
Ayaya
Hey, Aisu! You didn't tell me what I'm supposed to do yet!
 
There was an unnatural silence. Aisu wasn't going to reply, was she/it/thing?
 
I sighed, I may as well and figure out what I'm supposed to do.
 
After flying around aimlessly, I didn't really find anything that was of any use at all. This planet was full of mountains. No life or anything.
 
Giving up, I stared up into space. There were beautiful sights to behold out here.
 
Unknown to life back on Earth, I felt like this was for me, and me alone.
 
Indubitably, it was beautiful, and I took my break staring at the "sky".
