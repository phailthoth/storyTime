 
After a while, I found the mountains that I decided to go to. Interestingly it happened to be the mountains closed to where I lived.
 
From a distance, it looked quite nice. Indubitably, a beautiful part of nature.
 
Going into the forest nearby, I was surprised it wasn't that thick. Infact, it looked quite open in most places.
 
I couldn't help but feel amazed at the surreal, natural beauty of it all.
 
Along the way, I found a nice lake near the base of the mountains. The water was crisp, clear, and delicious to drink from.
 
I stayed there and relaxed for a while, drinking the scenery in - as well as the water.
 
Eventually, I grew hungry and looked around for something to eat.
 
I found some wild plants to eat. Since I lived with my mother in the middle of nowhere for a long period of time, finding the right ones to eat wasn't difficult.
 
After eating, I laid around and relaxed. Should I be looking for the person I'm supposed to meet?
 
However, night struck and an aurora shone. It looked very nice, and I was struck with awe. 
 
I hadn't seen anything like it before. It looked absolutely amazing.
 
However, before I knew it, the soothing lights blanketed me lightly in sleep.
