 
Growing up, I was never anything special. I just went about on my way for the most part.
 
In all honesty, there wasn't much for me to do. I just grew up with my parents in the middle of nowhere.

I couldn't say it was all bad, but nothing ever happened. Maybe an occasional volcano eruption, but that was very negligible.

It's time for your adventure, Ayaya. As I have done before, you shall traverse the world in search of treasures.
Ayaya
What do you mean, mother? I thought we lived here as mere normal people, up here in the middle of nowhere.
Mother
That may have been the case, but growing up I was sent out on an adventure, and it's your time to do so as well.
Ayaya
What do you mean? Where and what am I supposed to do?
Mother
That's for you to decide, I wish you luck.
 
Walking outside of the house, I was confused as what my mother wanted. All I was given was a bag and was sent out the door.
 
Eventually, I reach a row of trees and decide that it would be a good time to take a break.
 
I decide to look into my bag and notice there's a sheet of paper with words written on it.
Paper
Oh, I have friends in the mountains near by, the city, somewhere near the railroad, and in space.
Paper
It's your decision as to where you want to go, get to it! - Mother
Ayaya
I wonder where I should go, then...
